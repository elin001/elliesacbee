questions i have for past 19 years data: 
- trend of hate crimes against asian people?
- trend of hate crimes against LGBTQ people
  - this will involve grouping, as reported offenses are delineated by anti-gay, anti-lesbian, anti-trans, anti-homosexual, anti-bisexual
- trend of hate crimes based on citizenship status

notes on 2021 data (https://data-openjustice.doj.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2022-08/Hate%20Crime%20In%20CA%202021.pdf)
- most of the race/ethnicity/national origin bias was committed against Black (27%) and Asian (13.4%)
- most of the religious bias was anti-jewish (10.4%)
  - most of the anti-jewish hate crimes were committed against religious organizations, not individuals
- sexual orientation bias made up 16.7% of the total overall hate crimes
  - anti-gay male was 11.3%
  - anti-homosexual was 3.8%
  - anti-lesbian was 1.4%
- there were 43 anti-trans hate crimes in 2021
